Found various articles on the internet comparing performance of BDB ( Berkley DB ) and MySQL
BDB performs much better than MySQL in most of the comparative articles
There needs to be a discussion when it comes to selecting back end storage for persistance.
My vote goes for BDB for performance.
The arguement mostly will be between performance and actual 'view' of the persistance mechanism using PHPMyAdmin and MySQL
